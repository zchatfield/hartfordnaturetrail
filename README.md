# hartfordnaturetrail
The Hartford Natural trail is a celebration of existing public green spaces in the city of Hartford. It is beginning by
focusing on the Southern neighborhoods. Users will be able to learn about each green space including what native plants 
are present there or what can be grown and harvested (if there are community garden sites). 
Users will also be able to map out routes between locations to explore the trail.
